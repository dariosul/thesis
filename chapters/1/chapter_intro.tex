%\item[\textbf{Chapter 1}] contains a statement of
%the claims which will be proved by this dissertation followed by an overview of the structure of the document itself.
%\item[\textbf{Chapter 2}] describes in details the open problem which is to be tackled together with its context, its impact and the overall motivation for the research overall.
%\item[\textbf{Chapter 3}] gives the new research, its methodology, the algorithms involved, the new solution, the new work done. Formal proofs and arguments are made here. This is the first of the two contributions expected in a thesis for a graduate degree.
%\item[\textbf{Chapter 4}] is where the experiments and the methodology for them is fully described. The first part includes all details of how the empirical side of the research has been conducted. Note that not every thesis has this empirical portion.
%\item[\textbf{Chapter 5}] includes the evaluation of the data presented above and the comparisons with the work of others, to show how much better the new approach is. This is the second of the two contributions expected in a thesis for a graduate degree. Note that this part could be consolidated into the chapter above.
%\item[\textbf{Chapter 6}] contains a restatement of the claims and results of the dissertation. It also enumerates avenues of future work for further development of the concept and its applications.

In this thesis, we consider solving linear inverse problems using nonconvex l p and TV p
regularizers with 0 < p < 1, and applications of the proposed optimization models in
the general area of signal recovery including signal denoising and compressive sensing
of 1-D signals and 2-D images. 

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the
literature relevant to the problems considered, discuss the motivations for improving
the existing methods, and describe the main contributions and structure of the thesis.

\section{The Localization Problem: Motivation} \label{problem}


The problems of locating a radiating source from range measurements or from range-difference measurements collected using a network (or array) of passive sensors have received significant attention in the signal processing literature owing to their importance to many applications including teleconferencing, wireless communications, surveillance, navigation, and geophysics \cite{SmithAbel, ShcauRob, Yao, Huang, CheungChan, LiHu, Cheung, Sayed, classMDS} ([1]–[10]). In this paper, which considers both problems, the main focus is on efficient computation of least squares (LS) estimates of the source’s coordinate vector. The models that we consider for the said vector are based on  the assumption that the sensor network can be used, along with some form of preprocessing, to obtain (noisy) range or range-difference measurements. From a practical standpoint, this is a simplifying assumption (e.g., in nonline-of-sight scenarios), albeit one commonly made in \cite{Cheung} and \cite{classMDS} ([7] and [8]). Even so, the resulting location estimation problems are nonconvex and, therefore, rather difficult to solve globally, which explains why only approximate solutions to them have appeared in \cite{SmithAbel}, ~, \cite{LiHu} ([1], [2], [5],) and \cite{Cheung}. We should also mention here the family of data fusion methods \cite{Sayed} in which linear least squares problems are constructed via subtraction of equations. However, these methods do not provide optimal solutions since they implicitly assume the existence of an error-free measurement. In this paper, we first consider the problem of source localization from range measurements. In Section II we provide a result that explains why a recently proposed semidefinite relaxation (SDR) \cite{Cheung} of the R-LS approach to this problem may yield an accurate approximation; however, we also show that the SDR may lead to a poor approximation. For lack of a good solution to the R-LS problem, we then turn our attention to an SR-LS approach. Although the latter approach also leads to a nonconvex problem, we show that this problem can be efficiently and globally solved. Then we go on to consider the source localization problem from range-difference measurements in Section III. Our main results here concern an SRD-LS approach to this problem. In particular, we show that despite the fact that the said SRD-LS problem is also nonconvex, it can be efficiently solved, and we provide the details of an algorithm that computes the global solution of this problem. We end Section III by remarking that an SDR approach applied to a corresponding RD-LS criterion leads to extremely poor solutions. Several numerical examples suggest that the exact SR-LS and SRD-LS solutions can be more accurate by several orders of magnitude than existing approximate SR-LS and SRD-LS estimates, and than SDR-based approximations of the R-LS and
RD-LS solutions.

%
%why the problem is important, what its impact is and what its application, if any. Here you are free to elaborate and write as much as you think is necessary to avoid the examination doubt that you have a brilliant new solution to a trivial and unimportant issue.
%
%"The Craft of Research" by Wayne Booth \cite{booth1}, which can be found in the main library at Q180.55 M4B66. From there I have transferred to my writing a fairly simple structure for talking about the topic of the research, with the question to be asked and its motivation and significance. It goes as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item {\textit{I am trying to learn about (working on, studying...)}}
%\item {\textit{because I want to find out....}}
%\item {\textit{in order to understand...}}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Another way of looking at this is to ask the
%\textit{what}, \textit{why} and \textit{where}, starting from a \textit{setting} of the problem with a first point A, stating what the \textit{goal} is at point B and having an \textit{action link} between the two which will encompass your new solution. As surprising as this may be to some of you, I found reading a book from Microsoft very useful: "Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 to Create Presentations That Inform" \cite {atkin}. The goal of the book is to improve presentations with Power Point, but there is a lot that can be transferred towards \textit{effective communication} for a thesis.
%
%In summary, my view of the second chapter on
%\textit{"The Problem to be solved"} is as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item {\textit{Not} all the background and definitions (boring!) - use instead just-in-time explanations as needed in every context as it comes up;}
%\item {Motivation in depth;}
%\item {Tutorial high level explanation, where it is important to choose the right pitch: who is the audience? who are you teaching here?}
%\item {Make it exciting, make it current, make it important - why do I want to keep reading?}
%\item {Should you list here the solutions from other researchers? I think not, list instead the different facets of the problems that other researchers have attacked.}
%\item {A taxonomy can be extremely useful to place your problem and its particular special features within the perfect context of the overall area, as you need to make sure that the reader understands perfectly what you are trying to solve.}
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Contributions and Organization of the Thesis}

\subsection{Contributions  of the Thesis} \label{contributions}
single source localization

something like:

the material developed here / mathematical tools and methods are suitable for many different scenarios 
OR
can have different world life applications, for example: TOA, TDOA, static positioning using UWB range measurements. 

This work mostly investigated possible localization solution for the wireless sensor networks that use radio frequency measurements to obtain the range or range-difference measurements. However, some of the methods presented in this work can also be applied for other mediums, i.e. ultrasonic, sonic, light.
