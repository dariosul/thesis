Influense of sensor geometry on the accuracy of the proposed methods. For example, one of the highest impacts on accuracy degradation is Geometric Dilusion of Presicion. Optimum sensor arrangement is a separate research area. 

Multi-source localization, when the range measurements were obtained from the energy-based readings.
