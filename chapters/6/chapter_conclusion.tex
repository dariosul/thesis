\startchapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this thesis we have studied the solution methods for the single source localization. In particular, we focused on the ranging techniques, namely range and range-difference based methods. For both types of measurements, we used the nonlinear least squares formulations to estimate the source location. 

In Chapter 2, we turn our attention to the global methods for solving the approximation of the nonlinear least squares problem. We begin by
transforming the SR-LS and SRD-LS algorithms \cite{BeckStLi} into an
iterative procedure. At each iteration the algorithms find a global solution to an  adaptively weighted SR-LS (SRD-LS) subproblem that, as iterations proceed, approximates closely the LS solution.  Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods \cite{IRWSg}.


In Chapter 3,  a new iterative method for locating a radiating source based on noisy range measurements have been proposed. The method is developed by transforming the original least-squares problem to a difference-of-convex-functions programming problem which is in turn relaxed to a sequential convex minimization based on PCCP that can be efficiently solved with an infeasible initial point. By imposing additional constraints, we  enforce the iteration path towards the LS solution. Several strategies to secure a good initial point are also provided.  Along the way, we see that CCP allows a natural embedding of the LS formulation for localization into a sequential convex formulation in a sense that few additional terms and functions are introduced into the procedure \cite{PCCP}. Simulation results demonstrate promising localization performance when compared with some best known results from the literature.

In Chapter 4, we revisit the localization problem based on range-difference measurement. We first convert the unconstrained LS problem to constrained LS and develop an iterative method for solving the constrained problem.  The central part of the procedure is a convex quadratic programming (QP) problem that needs to be solved in each iteration to provide an increment vector that updates the present iterate to the next towards the solution of the localization problem at hand. Later in the chapter, we apply a similar technique to the range-based localization problem, where at each iteration we solve a relaxed SOCP problem.

An area of immediate extension of this work is its application to the problem of tracking of moving objects. As shown in Sec. 4.3. the average execution time of the non-optimized implementation of the algorithms is in the order of few seconds. This opens a possibility to study the more efficient implementation of algorithms as well as a possibility of their embedding into tracking and navigation systems.

One of the areas of future interest is study and mitigation of the influence of sensor geometry on the accuracy of the developed methods. In any ranging localization system, the geometry of the sensor network  highly affects positioning precision.   When evaluating the performance of the new positioning algorithms, it is important to  take this influence into account. One such metric, called the Geometric Dilution of Precision, has attracted a lot of research interest, including the indoor positioning \cite{Sharp, Sharp2}. Geometric dilution of precision defines a ratio between the error in range (or range-difference) measurement itself and the localization error.

Another area of future work is study of influence, detection  and elimination of outliers in the sensor readings that are not related to the sensor accuracy claimed in the manufacturing documentation. In practice there is always a possibility of failure of one or few of the sensors in the network. 

Multiple source localization in wireless sensor networks is another interesting problem related to the current work. The problem has attracted a particular interest when applied to surveillance, tracking and wildlife monitoring. An interesting work on multiple source localization based on compressed sensing has been presented in \cite{LiuCS, LinCai}.
