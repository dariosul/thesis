\textbf{ABSTRACT}

In this thesis, we develop new solution methods for the problem of localizing a single radiating source based on range and range-difference measurements. 
potentially applicable to wireless sensor networks where range or range-
difference measurements can be obtained utilizing RF signals. We remark that the
methods and solution techniques proposed in the thesis are of general nature, and
hence potentially useful in other scenarios that include localization problems for net-
works involving ultrasonic, sonic, or light sensors.
